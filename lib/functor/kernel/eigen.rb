  # One the nice things you can do with #eigen, is define class attributes
  # without having to open a `class << self` block.

  # NOTE: This was once called `#meta`, but meta is such a generic
  # and overly used term that 'eigen' was decided upon as a better
  # choice. You can thank or blame _why for the term, if you like.
